 ## ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About <a name = "about"></a>
 Provide the functionality to access, manage and store device topologies.
 ## üëæ Why Java <a name = "whyJava"></a>
1. Java is easy to learn.
2. Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.
3. Java is object-oriented.
This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.

Java is platform-independent.
One of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move easily from one computer system to another. The ability to run the same program on many different systems is crucial to World Wide Web software, and Java succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary levels.
 ## üëÆüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Functional requirments <a name="functionalRequirments"></a>
1. Read a topology from a given JSON file and store it in the memory.
2. Write a given topology from the memory to a JSON file.
3. Query about which topologies are currently in the memory.
4. Delete a given topology from memory.
5. Query about which devices are in a given topology.
6. Query about which devices are connected to a given netlist node in
a given topology.
## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Used Technologies <a name="usedTechnologies"></a>
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - integrated development environment 
- [Junit 5](https://junit.org) - Testing framework
- [Json parser](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) - Json parser package
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - as a building tool
## üìÑ Topology API Documentation<a name = "topologyApiDocs"></a>
### üèÅ Getting started <a name = "gettingStarted"></a>
First, you need to create an instance of TopologyApi class
```
TopologyApi topologyApi=TopologyApi.createTopologyApi();
```
Second, read the topology json file
```
topologyApi.topologyApiUtilities.readJson(defaultPath);
```
### üéØ Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
Get all topologies from memory:
```
ArrayList<Topology> topologies=topologyApi.topologyApiUtilities.getTopologies();
```
Delete a topology with Id from memory, return **true** on successfull deletion, **false** if not found:
```
Boolean isDeleted=topologyApi.topologyApiUtilities.deleteTopology("top1");
```
Query about which devices are in a given topology:
```
Topology topology=topologyApi.topologyApiUtilities.getTopology("top1");
ArrayList<Component> components=topology.getComponents();
```
Query about which devices are connected to a given netlist node in
a given topology:
```
 Component component=topologyApi.topologyApiUtilities.getComponent(components,"res1");
 HashMap<String,String>devices=topologyApi.topologyApiUtilities.getNetList(component);
```
Write a given topology from the memory to a JSON file, return **true** on successfull writing operation, **false** on failure :
```
 topologyApi.topologyApiUtilities.writeJson(topology,outputPath);
```
